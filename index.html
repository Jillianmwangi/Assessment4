            <h1>I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth. </h1>
            <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completeing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

            <h1>Such a life-changing <br> experience. Highly <br> recommended!</h1>
            <p>"Before joining the boot camp, I've <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from proffesionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait loing for <br> assistance. The agile team project, in <br> particular was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial could ever have. In <br> fact, I've often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly <br> helped me to land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after recieving mulitiple <br> offers. 100% recommend."</p>
